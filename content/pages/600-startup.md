Willemstad allows you to customise your Startup Screen in a myriad of ways.

## Startup Background Image
Willemstad allows you to put in a background image to the startup screen. This need not be an image too — you can use whatever CSS allows you, from a colour (like `black`), to a `RGB`/`HSL`/`HEX` colour value, to even `linear-gradient` and `radial-gradient`!

You can also use the `url()` function to do more, such as put an image you found on the web. Even `gif` works too — they will actually be animated as you open Obsidian!


## Gradient Startup Progress Bar
This applies a gradient to the startup progress bar. You can also customise the colour of the bar, by applying a colour, a `linear-gradient`, a `radial-gradient` or whatever so you wish to `Gradient Startup Progress Bar — Colour`.
