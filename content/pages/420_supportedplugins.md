*Willemstad* is compatible with all core plugins. As a rule of thumb, most (if not all) community plugins are compatible with *Willemstad*.

Some plugins, however, are actively and explicitly supported â€” that is to say, it has been hand-styled to fit the theme better:

- Style Settings
- Calendar
- Sliding Panes
- Admonitions
- Dataview
- Breadcrumbs
- Kanban
- Advanced Tables
- Banners
- Get Info
- CookLang Plugin
- Emoji Toolbar
- Maps of Content
- CMenu
- Footnote & Citation Indicator
- Settings Search
- Longform

If you would like more plugins to be actively supported, you can either help by [writing a feature request on GitHub](https://github.com/tingmelvin/willemstad-x/issues), or craft CSS/SCSS code for them.
