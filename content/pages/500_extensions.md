As a powerful tool, Obsidian offers a variety of ways that allows for *Willemstad* to enhance your experience.

*Willemstad* does this predominantly in two ways, via the use of:

1. [CSS Classes](/ext/css/), which can be inputted as `cssClass:` at the top of the note as part of the YAML frontmatter, and,
2. [Admonition](/ext/adm/), which allows us to render pretty-looking tables, infoboxes, and more, that <u>renders exactly in Live Preview as in with Reading mode</u>.
