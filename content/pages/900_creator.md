I'm a masters candidate at the [London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/) reading demography and health.
Previously, I completed another masters in Modern South Asian Studies at the [University of Oxford](https://www.southasia.ox.ac.uk/), and read politics and international relations for my undergraduate education at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/).

â€¦and I spent two years in the army as part of mandatory conscription, dealing with ammunition.

I'm not a particularly interesting person, but I love soaking up knowledge and new information, and getting to know nice and kind people, so get in touch if you want to chat!
