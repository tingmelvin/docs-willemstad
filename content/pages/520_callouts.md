Since Obsidian 14.0, Callouts has been available to Obsidian users, mimicking the function of Admonitions.

Willemstad comes preloaded with styling for certain custom Callout types:

| Class      | Description                                         |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| [!table](/ext/co/table/)  | Renders true-to-Reading-mode tables in Live Preview |
| [!infobox](/ext/co/infobox/) | Renders wiki-style infoboxes                        |
|            |                                                     |

## To use

To use custom Callouts, just use the syntax as mentioned on the [Obsidian Help wiki](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Use+callouts).
