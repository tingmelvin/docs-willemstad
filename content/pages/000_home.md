-> Hi! ðŸ‘‹ <-

Welcome to Willemstad's theme documentation website! I do hope you find the documentation here useful, and it convinces you to start using Willemstad, or helps you with using the theme!

If you would like to contribute to adding/editing Willemstad's documentation, you can submit a pull request to the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/tingmelvin/docs-willemstad).

Alternatively, if you need more help or would like to chat, you can find me on Discord as `Melvin#7545`.

-> Hope you enjoy your stay here! <-

## Getting Started
1. Before you can enable <u>Willemstad</u> you will need to choose which version of Willemstad you intend to use.
	1. There are two variants of <u>Willemstad</u>, **Willemstad X** and **Willemstad for Shimmering Focus** (Willemstad SF).
		1. If you want a *fully fledged theme*, **Willemstad X** would be more appropriate â€” this can be found in the Community Themes store within Obsidian itself, under ` Settings â†’ Appearance â†’ Themes: Manage â†’ Willemstad`.
		2. If you would like to use <u>Willemstad</u> with the theme *Shimmering Focus*, please use **Willemstad SF** instead. This can be downloaded [on GitHub](https://github.com/tingmelvin/willemstad). Simply download the `obsidian.css` file, and drop it into `.obsidian/themes`. Remember to enable it in ` Settings â†’ Appearance â†’ CSS Snippets`.
2. Once installed, you are highly recommended to also install the [Style Settings](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-style-settings) plugin, as it enables customisation options.
	1. This plugin is also used by most of the major themes, so it is highly recommended to have it *anyway*, even if you do not choose to use Willemstad.
3. VoilÃ ! You're ready to use <u>Willemstad</u>!
