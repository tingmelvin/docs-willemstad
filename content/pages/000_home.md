Hi! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to Willemstad's theme documentation website! I do hope you find the documentation here useful, and it convinces you to start using Willemstad, or helps you with using the theme!

If you would like to contribute to adding/editing Willemstad's documentation, you can submit a pull request to the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/tingmelvin/docs-willemstad).

Alternatively, if you need more help or would like to chat, you can find me on Discord as `Melvin#7545`.

Hope you enjoy your stay here!
