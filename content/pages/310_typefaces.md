Font typefaces are an importance part of the user experience, and as such, specifc font pairings have been carefully chosen for *Willemstad* to ensure a pleasant visual experience whilst using Willemstad and Obsidian.

These two font pairings are *Manrope, paired with DM Sans*, and *Inter*. These can be quickly accessed in *Style Settings*, under  `Willemstad → Typography → Font Pairings + Enable Custom Fonts`. These are accompained with *DM Mono*, which is Willemstad's monospace font (used for editing tables and code).

## Using your own custom fonts

Fear not if you would like to use your own fonts. You can opt to choose the `Custom Fonts` options under `Willemstad → Typography → Font Pairings + Enable Custom Fonts`, and specify the fonts of your choice in `Willemstad → Typography → Font Typeface Customisaton`.

*Willemstad* also comes embedded with more fonts: *Crimson Pro* and *MathJax Main* are provided for use in the [Writing](/ext/css/writing/) and [LaTeX](/ext/css/latex/) CSSClass respectively.

## Why is Inter embedded into Willemstad X, isn't that included in Obsidian proper?

Yes, it is. Inter is included in Obsidian proper. However, most people will download Inter onto their computers, and Obsidian will use the font with the name that is present in your computer. Moreover, most people (including myself) download/-s/-ed Inter from Google Fonts, which is probably the most outdated version you can get of the font. (No proper italics, need I say more?!) By embedding Inter, alongside the other fonts, allows me to quality control and ensure the quality of your experience.
