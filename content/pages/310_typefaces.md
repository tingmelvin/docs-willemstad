Font typefaces are an importance part of the user experience, and as such, specifc font pairings have been carefully chosen for *Willemstad* to ensure a pleasant visual experience whilst using Willemstad and Obsidian.

These two font pairings are *Manrope, paired with DM Sans*, and *Inter*. These can be quickly accessed in *Style Settings*, under  `Willemstad → Typography → Font Pairings + Enable Custom Fonts`. These are accompained with *DM Mono*, which is Willemstad's monospace font (used for editing tables and code).

Fear not if you would like to use your own fonts. You can opt to choose the `Custom Fonts` options under `Willemstad → Typography → Font Pairings + Enable Custom Fonts`, and specify the fonts of your choice in `Willemstad → Typography → Font Typeface Customisaton`.

*Willemstad* also comes embedded with more fonts: *Crimson Pro* and *MathJax Main* comes embedded for use in the [Writing](/ext/css/writing/) and [LaTeX](/ext/css/latex/) CSSClass respectively.
