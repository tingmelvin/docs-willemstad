As a rule of thumb, I do not take donations and/or sponsorships for Willemstad.

Developing Willemstad in itself has been a significant learning experience, and I'm intent on making that my main takeaway from it. You can best support me by [starring Willemstad's GitHub page](https://github.com/tingmelvin/willemstad-x), or by [filing a bug report or feature request](https://github.com/tingmelvin/willemstad-x/issues).

If you would like to contribute monetarily, there are three ways you can do so:
- Support my fellow theme devs
	- Particularly, [Cecilia of Primary](https://ko-fi.com/ceciliamay) and [Chris of Shimmering Focus](https://ko-fi.com/pseudometa). Both of them played the most significant roles in making Willemstad possible!
- [Purchase an Obsidian.md Catalyst license](https://obsidian.md/pricing)
	- Support Licat and Silver, who has made this app of our dreams a reality for us!
- Donate to your local charity!
	- Particularly those supporting LGBTQ people; AAPIs (for North America); water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) in lower- and middle-income countries.
